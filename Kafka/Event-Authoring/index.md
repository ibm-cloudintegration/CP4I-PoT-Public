| [New Customer Orders](NewCustomerOrders/index.md)       |**Discover topics and Filter events** For this scenario, you need a source of order events. A good place to discover sources of event streams to process is the catalog in Event Endpoint Management.  <br>When processing events, we can use filter operations to select a subset that we want to use. Filtering works on individual events in the stream.

| [Identify Suspicious Orders](IdentifySuspiciousOrders/index.md)       |**Join events** Join related events that occur within a time window.  **Event destination** Save the results to a Kafka Topic in Event Streams so that future automatic actions can be done based on event triggers 
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Enrich Topic with data from DB](EnrichWithRefData/ReadMe.md)       |**Enrich events with reference data** Track the hourly number of events captured by door sensors in each building and enrich with data from DataBase.

| [Payment from New Customers](PaymentNewCustomer/Lab_2/ReadMe.md)       |**Event destination** The order management system and its payment gateway exchange customer orders over IBM MQ.
